# Melacha Plug - Turns Off On A Random Minute
A [Melacha](https://www.chabad.org/95906/) aware plug which knows when it's [Shabbos](https://www.chabad.org/633659/) or [Yom Tov](https://www.chabad.org/708510/), and will turn off for a random minute for every day that it's Shabbos or Yom Tov. 

This project is using [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).


## Use Case
To turn off Security cameras for a random minute during Shabbos or Yom Tov as a heter for public places (AYLOR before using yourself).
